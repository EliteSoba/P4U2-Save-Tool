# P4U2-Save-Tool
Quick web app that allows users to upload their P4U2 Steam save data, and it'll return a copy with:
* All titles available to choose
* All icons unlocked
* 9,999,999 P$ (The max displayable value; technically this goes up to 4,294,967,295 or maybe it gets negative at that point idk, the display stops working)
